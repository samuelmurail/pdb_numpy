Create a simple logo for a library called "PDB Numpy". This library is a python
library designed to facilitate working with Protein Data Bank (PDB) files in the
context of structural bioinformatics. 

The logo should be simple and modern, and should include the name of the library
("PDB Numpy") as well as an icon or symbol that represents the library's focus on
structural bioinformatics and PDB files. 

You could show a protein structure, like a DNA helix, chemical compounds and multiple sequence alignement.

The logo should be suitable for use on
the library's website, documentation, and other promotional materials.

As the library is developed in Paris Cit√© university, it should show the Eiffel tower
surrounded by an alpha helix and chemical compounds. The logo should have Blue color
as dominant color. The logo should be square.
