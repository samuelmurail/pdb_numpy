About PDB-numpy
===============

``pdb_numpy`` is a python library designed to facilitate working with PDB files
in the context of structural bioinformatics. The library builds upon the
powerful ``numpy`` library to provide efficient and easy-to-use tools for
reading, manipulating, and analyzing PDB files.

The library includes a number of functions for working with PDB files,
including functions for parsing PDB files and extracting relevant information,
such as atomic coordinates, residue identities, and structural information.
Additionally, ``pdb_numpy`` provides a range of functions for performing common
manipulations on PDB structures, such as aligning structures, superimposing
structures, and calculating RMSD values.


* Source code repository:

Main features:
--------------

- Reading and writing PDB/MMCIF files
- Selecting atoms
- Superimposing structures using sequences alignment
- RMSD calculation
- DockQ calculation
- Secondary Structure calculation (pseudo DSSP)

For more examples and documentation, see the ``pdb_numpy`` documentation at
